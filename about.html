        <p>The idea of Verbum is derived from the story of Sophronia in the book 'Invisible Cities' by Italo Calvino.</p>
        <p>"The city of Sophronia is made up of two half-cities. In one there is the great roller coaster with its steep humps, the carousel with its chain spokes, the Ferris wheel... The other half-city is of stone and marble and cement, with the bank,  the factories... One of the half-cities is permanent, the other is temporary, and when the period of its sojourn is over, they uproot it, dismantle it, and take it off, transplanting it to the vacant lots of another half-city."</p>
        <p>"...Here remains the half-Sophronia of the shooting-galleries and the carousels, the shout suspended from the cart of the headlong roller coaster, and it begins to count the months, the days it must wait before the caravan returns and a complete life can begin again."</p>
        <p>The idea clearly reflects the theme of Sophronia, showing two contrasting halves of the same entity - 'words'.</p>
